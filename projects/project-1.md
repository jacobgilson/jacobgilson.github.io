Created a new Unity computer application that allows users to simply click a command in AutoCAD to copy an XML file of a formwork drawing into clipboard and then process an upload of the file to Firebase Storage. This allows viewability in 3D and enables the user to easily edit specific parts of the drawing. This resulted in a 5000% time savings over the previous method. Updated the Doka AR app previously created to enable it to read serialized data and minimize storage space by 50%.
